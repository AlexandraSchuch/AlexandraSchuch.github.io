> I am a passionate, driven, and detail-oriented cybersecurity B.A.S graduate with a curious mindset that is continuously expanding my knowledge and skills through various projects/labs and certifications. I am a proud member of a local cybersecurity organization called "The Neon Temple," where I attend weekly meetings learning and interacting with other cybersecurity professionals. I made this site to keep track of my progress  and post cool resources I find throughout my journey to land my first Cybersecurity job.
