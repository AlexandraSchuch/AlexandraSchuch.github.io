<h1> Should You Pay The Ransom? </h1>

<div>
<p id="p0"> Ransomware was created by a man named Joseph Popp, who developed a program in 1989 called “AIDS trojan” or PC Cyborg, that was a Trojan spread by floppy discs. The floppy disc was disguised as an educational program to inform people about AIDS that when installed would slowly utilize a symmetric cryptography to encrypt all the files on the C: drive and demand payment of $189 to a PO box located in Panama to unlock their system. About 20,000 people around the world received floppy discs from Joseph Popp. Ultimately the AIDS Trojan failed due to many reasons but paved the way for today's ransomware attacks that are much more devastating, complex, and effective. This is due to advancements with the internet, email, and adaptation of new technology such as cloud computing, which means no more floppy discs to infect victims but instead can be done easily over the highly connected network of the internet. Along with the launch of electronic currencies such as Bitcoin, which allows criminals to be paid by victims for the most part anonymously, this sets up ransomware for a perfect disaster that allows it to thrive. “Ransomware attacks—which use malware to encrypt files on a computer or mobile device and render it unusable until a ransom is paid—present companies with an unsavory dilemma: pay a ransom to a criminal actor, or lose a potentially devastating amount of data, which could seriously compromise business operations” (Rempel, 2022). To pay or not to pay ransom has been a debatable topic for victims and both sides have reasonable arguments. </p>
</div>
 
<div>
<p> Currently no law exists in the US to ban victims from paying ransoms in a ransomware attack, but the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) strongly suggests not paying the ransoms. This leaves the decision ultimately up to the affected parties whether or not to pay the ransom. “When Atlanta was hit with SamSam ransomware in March 2018 it refused to pay the $51,000 ransom demand with the end result of being unable to work around the encryption and then spending $17 million and many weeks to rebuild its network” (Olenick, 2019). In this example, it shows that Atlanta tried to do the right thing by not paying the ransom but ultimately suffered by paying more than 300 times the ransom. Sometimes paying the ransom is worth the gamble of recovering data and company assets, if the risks and cost of not paying and losing everything exceeds the ransom payment. In fact, although cost is a heavy factor in whether to pay ransom, other reasons to pay ransom include faster recovery time, protection of customer and employee data, keeping the business from shutting down, and protecting the reputation of the business. If the ransomware victim were to be a city or government however, new factors come into play. Now people’s lives are potentially at stake. Criminals have “...begun branching out into “extortionware,” in which the hacker not only encrypts sensitive data, but then goes the extra step and threaten to publicly release it unless the institution complies with their demands” (Rempel, 2022). In the case of a government, having classified information publicly released could disturb the general welfare of the public and put the country in danger of war. Luckily, even if victims choose to pay the ransom, they may not have to pay the whole thing. Victims can hire a negotiator to settle agreements of ransom payment either through a third party or cyber insurance provider, which can potentially save the company money. </p>

<p> “Federal agencies and industry analysts agree that paying the ransom does more harm than good to the entire industry. While paying may appear to be a viable option, here is why your business shouldn't: It encourages attackers, it escalates payments, data isn’t always returned, and potential future legal issues” (Johnson, 2021). By paying the ransom, you not only are funding criminal activity and enticing the attacker to continue to do it more, but you are also putting a target on your company to be an easy target because you paid. Why wouldn’t anyone take an opportunity to do something if they saw it was successful the first time and it made them money at the same time? Attackers have become even more greedy because they’ve seen how effective ransomware is, that even after companies pay one payment to receive the decryption key, some have taken it a step further and demanded a second payment to guarantee that none of the victim’s data will not be released. Until the attack is no longer effective or making money, ransomware will continue to thrive and evolve. By not paying, you put everyone one step closer to stopping or slowing down attacks and forcing attackers to change their strategies. Even though it is not currently illegal to pay ransom, in the future “Being involved in ransomware payments -- whether as the victim, a cyber insurance firm or financial institution -- the advisory said, could potentially violate Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations” (Johnson, 2021). Lastly, even if the victim does pay the ransom, it still isn’t guaranteed that the victim will receive a decryption key to get their data back. The attacker could essentially take the money and run.</p> </div>

<div>
<p> When it comes to whether or not to pay the ransom, I feel it is not that black and white. Each incident is independent and unique from one another and how prepared the victim is before the attack can help really influence the overall decision especially having an offline backup but even then, sometimes these things fail, or other factors can play a bigger role in whether to pay ransom. If a company is small, they may not be able to even afford to pay the ransom. While if a company is big, they may still pay the ransom secretly and remain silent about the attack so as not to destroy their public image, recover critical assets, and have minimum downtime. However, if I had to pick one over the other, I would say not to pay the ransom. In my opinion, there are a lot of risks in paying the ransom that for the most part outweigh the positives. Even if a company feels that they have no other option, it is still very risky. They could lose all their data, money, trust, face future legal issues, and more. Everything lies in the faith of the attacker to honor the agreement. “According to a 2021 Sophos report, 92% of organizations don't get all their data back. Only 29% of those organizations that paid recovered even half the encrypted data” (Johnson, 2021). Even though organizations can never be 100% protected from attacks, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t put forth their best efforts to do so. At the moment, “one of the key ways to defend against ransomware is to have a disaster recovery plan in place so that the system software and configuration can be completely reloaded...” but also “keep up-to-date configuration backups, and keep a copy remote or on a device that is physically separate so a ransomware attack on the control system cannot propagate to all the backups. Physical and virtual separation of a set of backups is the greatest defense against ransomware. This applies to historical data as well, so that past operating data is not lost. There will always be some risk of losing your most recent information but have a plan to do routine backups as practical” (Labs, 2020).

</div>

#### <b> Actions they should take are: </b>
 
-	Isolate the infected systems immediately (whether they are wired, wireless or mobile phones).  
-	Consider turning off Wi-Fi and disabling any core network connections.  
- Isolate or turn off systems that haven’t been completely compromised. 
-	Secure backup data/systems by taking them offline and ensure they are free of malware. 
-	Report the attack to relevant authorities. 
-	Determine “Patient Zero” (the source of the attack) and shut them down. 
-	Disable all maintenance tasks.  
-	Securely collect partial portions of the infected data/ make backup of infected systems. 
-	Reset credentials for administrative and other system accounts. 
-	Safely wipe the infected systems and reinstall the OS. 

#### <b> IF backup is free of malware, then use it to restore devices. </b>

-	Connect devices to clean network. 
-	Download, install and update the OS and all other software. 
-	Run antivirus.  
-	Reconnect network. 
-	Monitor network traffic.  
-	Run antivirus scans to determine if infection remains.

#### <b> IF the backup is infected, then attempt to use various ransomware decryption tools to unlock files. If one tool doesn’t work, then restore the backup of the infected version, and repeat the process or try another tool.  </b>

-	Consider doing a memory dump to determine how files are being encrypted. 
-	Upload ransom note/sample encrypted file to an online ransomware identification tool to determine strain. 
-	Consider upgrading security systems to avoid future attacks. 

#### <b> If all possible options have been exhausted and the company has decided to pay the ransom: </b>

- Hire a ransomware negotiator.
-	Listen to the negotiator.  
-	If the company has a cyber insurance policy, then they need to look it over and figure out what is covered and what is not covered. 
-	Figure out if the ransomware actor is sanctioned (Negotiator should know) 
-	Allow the negotiator to come to an agreement with the ransomware actor. 
-	The negotiator will convert payment to whatever currency is demanded.  
-	Receive decryptor tool. 
-	Rewrite the decryptor tool provided by the ransomware actor to avoid any additional malware on the network. 
-	Decide on whether the company should restore the files on the existing network or replace them with new systems then restore the files. 
-	Highly recommended to replace the network systems and then restore the files. 
-	Consider upgrading security systems to avoid future attacks.
